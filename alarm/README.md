## Comp116-alarm
### No Disclaimer: But have not test for stream
### No collabration, but consult stackoverflow a lot
### Hours: 10 hrs

### Questions:
	1. This alarm system is not perfect. Many incident may occur without alrm. For example, nmap scan without payload is a huge miss
	2. Implement the alarm to trigger when there is no payload and has suspicious request to different ports with same ip
